# Eternal Hallelujah – 24 Anointed Tamil Worship Songs  
நித்திய அல்லேலூயா – 24 அபிஷேகிக்கப்பட்ட தமிழ் ஆராதனை பாடல்கள்  
(Albums 4, 5, 6 & 7)

All glory, honor, and praise to the Lord Jesus Christ —  
the Lamb who was slain before the foundation of the world,  
the Lion of the tribe of Judah who has prevailed,  
the Bright Morning Star who shines forever,  
the King of kings and Lord of lords who reigns eternally!

These 24 songs are a rising chorus of pure worship —  
born in the secret place, carried by the Holy Spirit,  
offered freely to magnify the name above every name.

From the dawn of the day to beyond the throne,  
from the cry of the broken heart to the shout of the redeemed,  
every note declares:  
**Jesus Christ is Lord!**  
**Hallelujah forever!**
